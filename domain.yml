The HR/Payroll System provides secure access to your pay information, as well as to links related to your employment, from any web enabled computer."

  utter_hrfaq1:
  - text: "All employees have Pay Statements available online. to access online Pay
    Statements, log into the system with your UserID and password. Search for and
    click the Pay Statement Task.  Hourly employees will be provided paper pay statements
    in addition to having access to their online earnings statements. This is necessary
    because not all hourly employees have access to computers during work hours."

  utter_hrfaq2:
  - text: "Your online Pay Statements will be available on your scheduled pay date.
    In many cases, the online pay statement may be available a couple of days before
    the actual pay date, although the funds will not be in your account and available
    for spending until the actual pay date."

  utter_hrfaq3:
  - text: "No. There will not be an email notification when Pay Statements are posted
    on line."

  utter_hrfaq4:
  - text: "Once you click on the Pay Statement Task, choose the year for the Pay Statement
    you would like to print and click Display. Click on the underlined Pay Statement
    Date to view. At the bottom of the page, click on Printer Friendly to bring a
    format that is easily printable of Save to File."

  - text: "All employee W2s are mailed on or around January 31 for the prior calendar
    year."

  utter_hrfaq6:
  - text: "W2s are mailed to home addresses of employees as of a date in mid-January
    each year. If you did not receive a form W2, you may access it online (beginning
    with 2008 W2s), similar to employee Pay Statements. Search for and click on the
    W-2 task. Enter the year for the W-2 you are wanting to locate and the last 4
    digits of your Social Security Number. You then will have access to the W-2 in
    a format that can be used for filing paper versions of federal and state tax returns."

  utter_hrfaq8:
  - text: "The payroll system is set up to accept only one direct deposit account.
    If you’d like to automatically transfer funds to your other financial accounts,
    contact your financial institution who may be able to make such arrangements for
    you."

  utter_hrfaq9:
  - text: "Overtime is paid at the rate of one and one-half times an employee’s regular
    rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a standard work
    week. “Hours worked” refers to the amount of time actually worked in a standard
    work week. Paid time off for sick leave, vacation, or holidays is not included
    in hours worked for the determination of overtime. Overtime hours and compensation
    is based on calculation using the above rate."

  utter_hrfaq10:
  - text: "For an updated payroll calendar listing pay dates and cut-off dates, visit
    Payroll Calendars on the website."

  utter_hrfaq11:
  - text: "The HR/Payroll System application is secured by the company’s network and
    security as with all applications. You can personally safeguard your information
    by keeping your password confidential. To ensure that your personal information
    and the company's confidential information remain secure, YOU must ensure that
    your computer stays secure."

  utter_hrfaq12:
  - text: "Employers are not expected to establish any hiring practices that conflict
    with the principles of sound personnel management. No one should be hired unless
    there is a basis for believing the individual is the best-qualified candidate.
    In fact, affirmative action calls for the hiring of qualified people."

  utter_hrfaq13:
  - text: "Yes. Quotas are rigid and exclusionary; they imply, This is what you must
    achieve, no matter what. Goals are flexible and inclusive; they imply, This
    is what we think you can achieve if you try your best. Goals are simply program
    objectives translated into numbers. They provide a target to strive for and a
    vehicle for measuring progress."

  utter_hrfaq14:
  - text: "No. Affirmative action policies provide equal opportunity to those groups
    which have been systematically denied it. Affirmative action is not the source
    of discrimination, but the vehicle for removing the effects of discrimination."

  utter_hrfaq15:
  - text: "Employees may request correction or deletion of a record containing information
    about themselves. Policies and contracts specify method, time frame, and to whom
    requests should be addressed."

  utter_hrfaq16:
  - text: "You should not charge for the first copy of an employee's own record; a
    fee of 10 cents per page may be charged for additional copies (no charge for time
    spent locating or assembling the file)."

  utter_hrfaq17:
  - text: "The file is normally located in the Department Personnel Office or the supervisor's
    office. Before you place any documentation in a personnel file, have a conversation
    with the employee. The employee should receive a copy of all material placed in
    the file."

  utter_hrfaq18:
  - text: "The employee or designated representative, the employee's supervisor, a
    prospective hiring department, Employee Relations and Labor Relations staff and
    other UC offices with a specific need."

  utter_hrfaq19:
  - text: "A historical body of information on an employee from date of hire to present,
    maintained by the person's name or by some identifying number or symbol."

  utter_hrfaq20:
  - text: "A single unwelcome sexual comment or advance, a supervisor who makes a few
    mild advances for a few minutes, stops, and apologizes with apparent embarrassment,
    a small number of minor incidents is less likely to constitute actionable sexual
    harassment."

  utter_hrfaq21:
  - text: "It depends on the seriousness of the incident. The appropriate corrective
    action may include a strong verbal warning, written warning, transfer, administrative
    leave, suspension, demotion, firing. Generally, you would take the same types
    of action taken for other forms of employee misconduct."

  utter_hrfaq22:
  - text: "No. Normally only one representative is allowed in a meeting between you
    and the employee. Ask the employee to clarify for you which individual will be
    the representative before you schedule a meeting."

  utter_hrfaq23:
  - text: "No. For example, a union representative is not appropriate in meetings to
    give work assignments, coaching sessions, or performance evaluation discussions.
    However, employees have a right to have a representative present if they reasonably
    believe that disciplinary action will result from a meeting."

  utter_hrfaq24:
  - text: "The intent of the performance cycle is to identify the key parts of each
    employee’s job, identify what it looks like when that is done well (meets your
    expectations as a manager), and how both you as manager and your employee will
    know when that is achieved (measurements).Phase 1 - Planning:  Creating goals
    and expectations between the employee and manager for the current year. Phase
    2 - Check-Ins:  Giving ongoing feedback throughout the year; identifying acomplishments,
    areas for improvement and adjusting the goals/expectations as necessary. Phase
    3 - Review:  Reviewing the year at the end of the performance period."

  utter_hrfaq25:
  - text: "It is quite likely that the goals/outcomes will change during the year.
    When they do, the manager and employee would discuss the new goals, and both agree
    to the expectations going forward. They would document the changes by updating
    the PPR document, and initial and date the new form to indicate understanding
    and alignment."

  utter_hrfaq26:
  - text: "An employee is welcome to add comments as a separate attachment. If they
    prefer to write a self-review, the employee is always welcome to request that
    their self-review, or other comments, be attached to the performance review form."

  utter_hrfaq27:
  - text: "The 3-5 goals should cover 80% or more of the job responsibilities. For
    the performance of other job duties, they can be identified and covered in the
    overall comments section. This section completes the narrative if the year."

  utter_hrfaq28:
  - text: "The process requires that you set goals at the beginning of the year. Since
    we have simplified the form to focus entirely on goals, if you do not get goals
    established, you will want to sit down right away with your employee and get agreement
    on outcomes expected for the year. Without goals established, there will be nothing
    to discuss during the review phase."

  utter_hrfaq29:
  - text: "Meet with your employee. Identify and agree on major pieces of the job.
    Use that list to determine performance for the year. Start the next period by
    identifying the major pieces of the job, what success looks like, and how that
    might be measured."

  utter_hrfaq30:
  - text: "Yes! Our classes provide detailed support on how to set goals. This program
    is offered twice a year based on the timing of the performance cycle. There is
    a online course (sign-up on blu) titled Setting Expectations and Individual Performance goals. 
    Additionally, Staff Learning and Development offers training for work
    teams upon request."
